-Son.

28:47.458 --> 28:49.000
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

28:49.166 --> 28:51.125
Noa, free all birds.

39:57.750 --> 39:59.958
How young you are.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.875
Without your mask.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.458
Without this.

40:08.833 --> 40:09.875
Speak up.

40:11.416 --> 40:14.333
Speak up.

Not mine.

No mask.

I am not...

40:22.500 --> 40:23.541
them.

40:26.458 --> 40:27.958
Explain yourself.

40:29.666 --> 40:31.500
They killed my father.

40:32.750 --> 40:34.541
Stole my village.

40:36.666 --> 40:38.458
I follow their tracks.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.541
Hmm.

40:50.166 --> 40:53.500
He was my village.

40:56.708 --> 40:58.708
They killed him.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.500
The Masks.

41:04.416 --> 41:05.541
[sighs]

41:14.000 --> 41:15.333
I am Raka.

I am Noa.

[Raka] Apes falling from the sky. Hmm.

41:40.375 --> 41:45.083
He was outside when they arrived.

41:45.250 --> 41:47.125
Did you see my clan?

41:48.291 --> 41:49.333
No.

41:50.208 --> 41:51.625
I hid.

41:52.833 --> 41:54.208
I survived.

41:55.666 --> 41:58.750
I protected our work.

42:08.166 --> 42:13.791
They are an ancient way to store ideas.

42:18.875 --> 42:21.500
The symbols have meaning.

42:25.583 --> 42:28.666
Apes understood this meaning...

42:28.833 --> 42:30.875
in the time of Caesar.

42:33.458 --> 42:36.875
The Masks, in my village...

42:38.375 --> 42:40.375
said that name...

42:42.333 --> 42:43.791
"Caesar."

42:44.875 --> 42:46.250
Shameful.

42:47.333 --> 42:49.541
The Masks take his name.

42:51.041 --> 42:52.416
Twist his words.

42:53.333 --> 42:55.041
Who is he?

42:55.833 --> 42:56.958
Not "is."

42:58.083 --> 42:59.083
"Was."

43:02.666 --> 43:06.916
Your clan does not know
the true Caesar. [grunts]

43:07.916 --> 43:11.125
Too many have forgotten who he was.

43:13.250 --> 43:16.041
I know Elders of my village.

43:16.208 --> 43:17.916
They made the law.

43:18.083 --> 43:20.833
-That is everything.
-[Raka chuckles]

43:21.208 --> 43:24.083
That is not everything.

43:24.875 --> 43:27.000
Long before your Elders...

43:27.166 --> 43:31.416
it was Caesar who taught us
what it means to be ape.

43:31.583 --> 43:36.041
He was our leader, our lawgiver.

43:36.208 --> 43:38.958
Apes together strong.

43:39.125 --> 43:41.833
Ape shall not kill ape.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.750
We, the Order of Caesar...

43:44.916 --> 43:46.666
follow his words.

43:46.833 --> 43:48.291
To this day...

43:49.666 --> 43:51.125
I follow.

43:52.791 --> 43:54.083
I am now...

43:55.416 --> 43:56.833
the last.

43:58.916 --> 44:00.833
The work continues.

44:03.458 --> 44:06.416
-[Raka hums]
-What is this place?

44:07.083 --> 44:09.958
We believe apes built this...

44:10.125 --> 44:13.666
as a refuge for humans.

44:13.833 --> 44:15.708
Now it is rare to see even one.

44:15.875 --> 44:21.166
But in Caesar's time,
there were vast herds of them.

44:22.250 --> 44:24.916
Can you imagine? [chuckles]

44:25.000 --> 44:29.541
Perhaps here,
humans were cared for, fed...

44:29.708 --> 44:33.500
maybe even taught. [laughs]

44:40.000 --> 44:41.083
What is it?

44:42.958 --> 44:44.125
Echo.

44:48.458 --> 44:49.500
Human.

44:52.291 --> 44:53.833
You have seen one?

44:54.666 --> 44:55.666
One.

44:57.500 --> 44:59.666
They are scavengers.

44:59.833 --> 45:01.541
Like boars.

45:01.708 --> 45:03.333
Only lesser.

45:03.500 --> 45:06.541
Humans are slow-witted, but...

45:08.708 --> 45:10.250
there was a time...

45:11.166 --> 45:15.083
when humans and apes lived side by side.

45:17.125 --> 45:18.916
[Raka chuckles]

45:19.000 --> 45:24.250
Yes, it is a puzzle. I know. But...

45:25.583 --> 45:28.333
they were important to Caesar. Hmm.

45:28.500 --> 45:32.666
So they are important to me.

45:37.166 --> 45:39.250
I have to get to my horse.

45:40.541 --> 45:42.083
Of course.

45:42.250 --> 45:43.416
Follow me.

45:47.125 --> 45:49.791
You do not know Caesar.

45:51.291 --> 45:53.666
You do not know books.

45:57.708 --> 45:59.666
You should stay here.

45:59.833 --> 46:02.291
There is much I could teach you.

46:02.375 --> 46:04.583
[horse neighs]

46:10.250 --> 46:11.250
Go away!

46:11.416 --> 46:13.791
-No! Come back!
-Pest!

46:13.958 --> 46:16.083
[Raka] Wait! Come back!

46:17.000 --> 46:19.875
There is no danger.

46:20.833 --> 46:22.916
That is the one.

46:23.083 --> 46:25.500
Stole from my village.

46:26.875 --> 46:30.291
She follows you from your village?

46:34.000 --> 46:38.750
Perhaps Caesar bids me travel.

46:42.833 --> 46:45.500
Wait here. The work continues.

46:45.666 --> 46:46.833
I have no time for...

46:47.000 --> 46:50.166
I will not slow you down.
I, too, keep a horse.

46:50.250 --> 46:51.583
[Raka chuckles]

46:55.500 --> 46:57.375
[Raka panting]

46:57.458 --> 47:00.166
Can we not slow down?

47:00.333 --> 47:01.333
No.

47:04.500 --> 47:06.458
I am sure she follows.

47:06.625 --> 47:07.958
I do not know why.

47:08.375 --> 47:11.625
[eagle screeches]

47:12.625 --> 47:16.375
[gasps] A beautiful bird!

47:18.583 --> 47:20.125
Eagle Sun.

47:21.208 --> 47:22.666
My father's bird.

47:23.833 --> 47:25.708
He follows to taunt me.

47:26.958 --> 47:30.750
This bird follows you too?

47:32.291 --> 47:35.208
We raise eagles, my clan.

47:35.958 --> 47:37.000
Sing to them...

47:37.958 --> 47:39.375
so they know us.

47:39.541 --> 47:40.708
A bond.

47:42.875 --> 47:44.208
Sing the song.

47:45.166 --> 47:46.375
Please.

47:49.708 --> 47:50.708
No.

47:52.708 --> 47:54.666
My father was Master of Birds.

47:54.833 --> 47:56.333
He sang to eagles.

47:58.541 --> 48:00.500
But I am not him.

48:02.458 --> 48:03.458
Shame.

48:04.875 --> 48:07.916
I would have enjoyed a song.

No, no, no.

49:34.541 --> 49:36.208
This is...

49:38.125 --> 49:39.625
important.

49:41.166 --> 49:43.333
They get cold.

49:46.500 --> 49:48.083
Show mercy.

50:10.083 --> 50:12.458
She is smarter than most.

50:18.250 --> 50:21.333
We will name her Nova.

50:23.500 --> 50:26.375
We name them all Nova.

50:27.416 --> 50:30.416
I do not know why.
It is from Caesar's time.

50:31.375 --> 50:36.208
Why did Caesar care so much for Echoes?

50:36.750 --> 50:41.416
Legend says he was reared by them...

50:42.958 --> 50:45.416
impossible as that may seem.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.125
Caesar legend is important.

50:51.125 --> 50:53.541
He was first Elder.

50:55.083 --> 50:57.958
He led with decency...

strength...

51:06.916 --> 51:08.291

51:13.166 --> 51:16.333
Caesar never had to share camp...

54:33.916 --> 54:35.833
She saw what I saw.

54:36.916 --> 54:38.500
It was in her eyes.

54:38.666 --> 54:39.875
She...

54:40.916 --> 54:42.208
reacted.

54:43.375 --> 54:44.375
How?

54:47.916 --> 54:49.666
As ape would.

54:57.416 --> 54:59.958
-If Echo comes, she must ride.
-Hmm.

55:00.041 --> 55:04.041
Is my young companion showing compassion
for our fellow traveler?

She is slow.

Then, of course, there is the gibbon.

55:39.083 --> 55:40.875
Very, very long arms.

55:41.208 --> 55:47.333
Is most unfortunate that the human
can only use its feet for walking.

55:48.333 --> 55:50.791
Imagine if you were falling from a tree.

55:50.958 --> 55:53.500
You only have two appendages
to save your life.

55:53.666 --> 55:56.958
But if you were able to use
both of your hands...

55:57.125 --> 55:59.083
and both of your feet...

55:59.250 --> 56:01.583
that's four times the safety.

56:01.750 --> 56:06.625
And I imagine that,
if I came across a special...

What is that?

Will you not say goodbye?

58:05.125 --> 58:08.208
I must find my clan.

58:09.916 --> 58:12.625
The Nova stays with her kind.

58:13.833 --> 58:15.458
You raise them up.

58:16.958 --> 58:20.708
Follow Caesar's word.

To remember...

who he was.

[Raka laughs exultantly]

01:04:21.375 --> 01:04:23.166
Caesar will forgive.

01:04:24.041 --> 01:04:25.625
Shall we continue?

01:04:45.875 --> 01:04:49.291

01:05:27.166 --> 01:05:29.541
What did I miss?

01:05:29.708 --> 01:05:31.166
She spoke.

01:05:34.041 --> 01:05:36.375
She called my name.

01:05:36.541 --> 01:05:38.875
You misheard.

01:05:39.041 --> 01:05:43.708
You said this Nova was smarter than most.

01:05:43.875 --> 01:05:45.333
[Raka] Within reason.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.750
Some intelligence, to be sure, but...

01:05:48.916 --> 01:05:50.458
I have a name.

01:05:52.375 --> 01:05:53.375
Mae.

01:05:57.791 --> 01:06:00.000
I know where they're taking your clan.

01:06:06.208 --> 01:06:07.375
[sighs]

01:06:09.375 --> 01:06:10.958
It's a human settlement.

01:06:12.625 --> 01:06:14.250
It's where I'm headed to.

01:06:14.875 --> 01:06:16.541
Looking for more like me.

01:06:16.708 --> 01:06:18.166
There are more...

01:06:19.083 --> 01:06:20.166
like you?

01:06:22.625 --> 01:06:24.458
There used to be more.

01:06:25.291 --> 01:06:28.333
You hid the truth?

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.708
My mother taught me silence...

01:06:32.208 --> 01:06:33.833
for my safety.

01:06:34.583 --> 01:06:37.583
You were safe with us.

01:06:38.166 --> 01:06:40.875
And still not true.

01:06:42.125 --> 01:06:44.583
Where is your mother now?

01:06:47.875 --> 01:06:49.833
I am alone.

01:06:50.625 --> 01:06:53.041
Huh. [sighs]

01:06:54.166 --> 01:06:56.375
As are we all.

01:06:57.583 --> 01:06:58.833
But now...

01:07:00.625 --> 01:07:02.791
we have each other.

Ah. [grunts]

01:07:16.916 --> 01:07:18.916
Let us have a fire.

01:07:19.083 --> 01:07:21.500

I feel good.

01:21:41.583 --> 01:21:44.791
Caesar was first Elder.

01:21:44.958 --> 01:21:48.958
Now I am Caesar.

01:21:49.041 --> 01:21:50.791
[apes chattering]

01:21:52.125 --> 01:21:54.208
He is not Caesar.

01:21:54.958 --> 01:21:57.833
[in sign language]

01:21:57.916 --> 01:21:59.666
[Proximus hooting]

01:22:02.333 --> 01:22:08.166
Now, when I think of all the treasures
left inside for us...

01:22:08.250 --> 01:22:09.541
Oh...

01:22:10.041 --> 01:22:13.000
I feel very good.

01:22:15.583 --> 01:22:18.000
It may be difficult to open.

01:22:19.083 --> 01:22:20.583
But not impossible...

01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:23.666
because we work together.

01:22:24.708 --> 01:22:27.083
All as one.

01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:29.166
As Caesar wanted.

01:22:29.333 --> 01:22:32.291
As Caesar required.

01:22:32.458 --> 01:22:35.125
[all] Apes together strong!

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Pull!

01:22:37.083 --> 01:22:38.958
-[whip lashing]
-[horses neighing]

01:22:42.166 --> 01:22:44.375

[grunting]

01:22:47.666 --> 01:22:49.500
[Sylva] Pull!

01:22:50.541 --> 01:22:52.500
[Proximus] Pull! More!

01:22:58.750 --> 01:22:59.875
Watch this.

01:23:01.625 --> 01:23:03.333
[electricity crackling]

01:23:10.541 --> 01:23:11.875
[gasps]

01:23:13.041 --> 01:23:14.708
-Pull!
-[apes] Pull!

01:23:14.875 --> 01:23:16.916
[Proximus] Pull!

01:23:21.875 --> 01:23:23.291
[Proximus] Yes!

01:23:23.833 --> 01:23:25.083
Yes! [echoes]

01:23:30.666 --> 01:23:32.500
More!

01:23:33.166 --> 01:23:35.208
[apes grunting]

01:23:37.708 --> 01:23:39.583
[Mae gasps]

01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:41.583
[apes chattering]

01:23:43.875 --> 01:23:45.250
Enough!

01:23:45.333 --> 01:23:47.750
[chattering stops]

01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:54.750
Maybe stronger tomorrow.

01:24:14.291 --> 01:24:15.708
Don't worry.

01:24:15.875 --> 01:24:18.208
Whoever's in there is either dead or gone.

01:24:19.875 --> 01:24:22.791
We've been bangin'
on that door for months.

01:24:23.541 --> 01:24:25.791
[chuckles and grunts]

01:24:25.875 --> 01:24:27.666
[Mae] Do you not know where we are?

01:24:28.291 --> 01:24:31.583
When things got bad
and the government went underground,

01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:33.625
this is where half of it went.

01:24:33.791 --> 01:24:36.958
With all their technology,
and all their weapons...

01:24:39.375 --> 01:24:40.708
Don't you understand?

01:24:41.625 --> 01:24:43.875
That ape cannot have what is inside the...

01:24:44.041 --> 01:24:47.166
You gotta stop thinking
about the way things were

01:24:47.333 --> 01:24:49.625
and start thinking about the way they are.

01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:51.708
This is a good life,

01:24:51.875 --> 01:24:54.250
and you have a chance to be a part of it.

01:24:54.833 --> 01:24:57.208
What, and build a world for the apes?

01:24:57.375 --> 01:25:00.166
It is already their world.

01:25:03.666 --> 01:25:04.958
[Trevathan sighs]

01:25:08.291 --> 01:25:11.250
There's hot water and fresh clothes
in that room back there.

01:25:12.833 --> 01:25:15.583
You'll feel better
when you get yourself cleaned up.

01:25:17.166 --> 01:25:19.625
You better figure out
how to be useful around here.

01:25:22.583 --> 01:25:24.208
[Elder chimp chittering softly]

01:25:26.583 --> 01:25:27.833
[Soona] Honored Elder...

01:25:28.916 --> 01:25:29.916
had to bend.

01:25:31.875 --> 01:25:34.083
We had no choice.

01:25:35.916 --> 01:25:37.458
You must accept.

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:39.833
[Soona sighs]

01:25:40.791 --> 01:25:41.958
It is law.

01:25:44.208 --> 01:25:49.208
The Elders did not tell us everything

01:25:49.375 --> 01:25:51.416
about this world.

01:25:52.333 --> 01:25:56.000
They did not tell us
because they did not know.

01:25:57.291 --> 01:26:00.416
They did not want to know.

01:26:06.875 --> 01:26:09.208
-You are different. [gasps]
-[staff thuds]

01:26:09.291 --> 01:26:11.625
[Sylva growls]

01:26:12.375 --> 01:26:13.541
Come.

01:26:24.416 --> 01:26:25.708
[Soona gasps]

01:26:26.625 --> 01:26:28.583
[Trevathan and Proximus laughing]

01:26:28.666 --> 01:26:31.041
[Trevathan] And that's why
they call it a toga party.

01:26:31.125 --> 01:26:32.791
[Proximus laughing]

01:26:34.333 --> 01:26:38.291
[Proximus] You are a funny
little human, Trevathan.

01:26:38.416 --> 01:26:41.041
[both continue laughing]

01:26:43.708 --> 01:26:44.916
[Proximus] Hey, come.

01:26:45.541 --> 01:26:46.583
Come, sit.

01:26:48.458 --> 01:26:49.458
Please.

-[staff thuds]
-[Sylva huffs]

01:26:51.958 --> 01:26:52.958
Go.

01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:54.666
Go.

01:27:03.041 --> 01:27:04.333
[grunts]

01:27:05.375 --> 01:27:07.708
Wonderful day, yes?

01:27:11.375 --> 01:27:14.291
You two have come a long way.

01:27:16.291 --> 01:27:18.583
An ape and a human

01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:20.375
traveling together is...

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.416
quite an adventure.

01:27:24.041 --> 01:27:26.083
[Trevathan and Proximus chuckle]

01:27:26.166 --> 01:27:27.625
[Proximus] You are Noa, yes?

01:27:28.333 --> 01:27:30.458
Welcome, Noa.

01:27:39.958 --> 01:27:41.041
[clattering]

01:27:45.458 --> 01:27:46.458
Go.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.458
Mae...

01:27:55.625 --> 01:27:59.250
you are familiar with the concept of...

01:27:59.875 --> 01:28:01.666
evolution?

01:28:01.833 --> 01:28:04.375
That is the human label, yeah?

01:28:04.541 --> 01:28:09.000
The advancement
that I crave requires time.

01:28:09.166 --> 01:28:13.041
Vast amounts of time that I do not have.

01:28:14.375 --> 01:28:17.583
Unfortunately, I am but a mortal ape.

01:28:17.666 --> 01:28:19.666
-[Proximus chuckles]
-[chuckles]

01:28:19.833 --> 01:28:24.833
So this is why I need to get the knowledge
inside that vault.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.291
I believe it will deliver

01:28:26.458 --> 01:28:29.708
instant evolution.

01:28:30.708 --> 01:28:32.875
Hmm. Noa.

01:28:33.916 --> 01:28:35.250
You don't understand.

01:28:36.666 --> 01:28:38.083
In their time,

01:28:38.250 --> 01:28:43.875
humans were capable
of many great things, yes?

01:28:44.041 --> 01:28:46.291
They could level mountains.

01:28:48.083 --> 01:28:50.500
They could speak across oceans.

01:28:50.666 --> 01:28:53.250
They could fly, Noa.

01:28:53.791 --> 01:28:55.625
Like eagles fly.

01:28:55.791 --> 01:28:58.875
But now, we will learn.

01:28:59.041 --> 01:29:02.541
Apes will learn. I will learn, yeah,

01:29:02.708 --> 01:29:05.583
from what is inside that vault.

01:29:06.041 --> 01:29:08.166
-[sighs]
-[Mae] It's impossible.

01:29:09.833 --> 01:29:11.291
No one's getting in there.

01:29:11.666 --> 01:29:15.333
[Proximus chuckles]

01:29:16.916 --> 01:29:19.125
Mae, Mae, Mae, Mae.

01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:26.625
My apes encountered your companions.

01:29:27.791 --> 01:29:31.166
I believe this map belonged to you.

01:29:31.791 --> 01:29:33.291
You see, Noa,

01:29:33.833 --> 01:29:36.250
before she was traveling with you

01:29:36.416 --> 01:29:40.500
and that old orangutan,

01:29:40.666 --> 01:29:43.916
Mae was with other humans.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.916
[â™ª suspenseful music playing]

01:29:46.916 --> 01:29:48.208
But sadly,

01:29:50.041 --> 01:29:53.541
my apes did not realize their value,

01:29:53.708 --> 01:29:57.333
so I was brought only bodies.

01:29:58.208 --> 01:30:02.625
I could not speak to them
like I can speak to you.

01:30:04.541 --> 01:30:05.541
I know...

01:30:06.666 --> 01:30:10.041
you are coming here
to get inside my vault.

01:30:10.208 --> 01:30:11.833
It is not yours!

01:30:11.916 --> 01:30:13.500
Oh.

01:30:13.625 --> 01:30:16.041
It is now, isn't it?

01:30:17.041 --> 01:30:19.375
And I will get inside.

01:30:20.291 --> 01:30:24.583
No matter how many apes it costs me.

01:30:25.458 --> 01:30:26.458
Noa.

01:30:26.916 --> 01:30:28.625
I...

01:30:28.708 --> 01:30:33.708
I have heard that you are
a very clever ape, yeah?

01:30:34.666 --> 01:30:35.666
Very clever.

01:30:35.833 --> 01:30:39.875
He repaired one of your
broken staffs, Trevathan.

01:30:42.791 --> 01:30:46.541
I have much use for clever apes.

01:30:46.708 --> 01:30:49.250
Now, can you tell me...

01:30:51.083 --> 01:30:55.125
did Mae tell you
how to get inside my vault?

01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:01.916
She told me nothing.

01:31:02.833 --> 01:31:04.500
Told you nothing! [slams fist]

01:31:04.666 --> 01:31:05.666
Nothing.

01:31:09.458 --> 01:31:11.333
Told you nothing.

01:31:15.541 --> 01:31:16.583
Noa.

01:31:17.583 --> 01:31:19.583
Come. Come with me.

01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:20.916
Come, come.

01:31:22.416 --> 01:31:24.000
I have something to show you.

01:31:25.041 --> 01:31:27.000
Come. Come.

01:31:28.833 --> 01:31:29.958
Come, Noa.

01:31:31.625 --> 01:31:33.708
Tell me, what do you see?

01:31:38.208 --> 01:31:40.250
[distant chatter]

01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:45.458
Stolen clans.

01:31:48.083 --> 01:31:49.500
Not clans.

01:31:51.375 --> 01:31:52.458
A kingdom.

01:31:54.041 --> 01:31:57.750
Noa, a kingdom for apes.

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:05.708
Humans can never be trusted.

01:32:06.416 --> 01:32:09.083
Where there are two that can speak,

01:32:09.625 --> 01:32:11.083
there must be more.

01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:18.958
Mae has come here to claim
the tools inside my vault.

01:32:19.125 --> 01:32:22.291
Tools that make humans strong

01:32:22.458 --> 01:32:24.541
and make them dangerous.

01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:29.250
That is why I must have them first.

01:32:29.416 --> 01:32:30.625
Yeah?

01:32:30.791 --> 01:32:35.833
They do not understand
that this is our time.

01:32:36.375 --> 01:32:38.500
This is my kingdom.

01:32:41.833 --> 01:32:44.875
I must destroy their kind.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.458
Unless we want to live in cages again.

01:32:56.416 --> 01:32:57.666
Come.

01:32:57.833 --> 01:32:59.333
Come, Noa.

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:00.833
Let us eat.

01:33:02.833 --> 01:33:03.875
Trevathan!

01:33:04.416 --> 01:33:05.916
Tell us a story.

01:33:06.416 --> 01:33:08.125
Make it a funny one.

[eagles calling]

01:33:31.125 --> 01:33:33.000
[Dar] They will not come.

01:33:36.791 --> 01:33:37.791
Why?

01:33:39.708 --> 01:33:42.125
Because Eagle Clan...

01:33:44.041 --> 01:33:45.125
is gone.

01:33:48.416 --> 01:33:53.500
Eagle Clan is here.

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:57.041
We are here.

01:33:59.541 --> 01:34:01.500
In land of Proximus.

01:34:03.250 --> 01:34:08.208
And Proximus has no need for eagles.

01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:27.416

You come to judge me?

01:34:51.875 --> 01:34:53.708
I judge myself.

01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:59.291
I promised our father

01:34:59.458 --> 01:35:01.041
I would bring them home.

01:35:05.458 --> 01:35:06.708
I failed.

01:35:08.958 --> 01:35:11.416
Eagle Clan belongs

01:35:11.583 --> 01:35:15.625
to Proximus Caesar now.

01:35:19.291 --> 01:35:21.875
That is the law.

01:35:37.291 --> 01:35:42.000
But the law is wrong.

01:35:45.333 --> 01:35:46.916
[Noa hooting]

[waves crashing]

01:36:29.791 --> 01:36:32.500
[Trevathan] Time for the evening lesson.

01:36:32.666 --> 01:36:35.583
It would be very good for you to be there.

[thud]

01:37:14.583 --> 01:37:17.250
[Noa] You did not come for Echoes.

01:37:18.916 --> 01:37:21.833
And you were not alone.

01:37:23.125 --> 01:37:24.208
[Mae] I'm sorry.

01:37:26.791 --> 01:37:29.208
Proximus's apes found our camp.

01:37:31.875 --> 01:37:33.416
They killed everyone.

01:37:34.791 --> 01:37:36.750
I barely escaped.

01:37:37.666 --> 01:37:39.458
I needed your help.

01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:43.083
-And I was afraid.
-The more you speak,

01:37:43.250 --> 01:37:45.250
the less I believe.

01:37:45.416 --> 01:37:47.333
I was wrong not to trust you.

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:48.500
And I know that now.

01:37:48.666 --> 01:37:51.791
I trust you only to help yourself.

01:37:54.166 --> 01:37:56.625
But that could help me now.

01:38:00.958 --> 01:38:02.416
I have questions.

01:38:03.791 --> 01:38:05.333
You answer true,

01:38:06.166 --> 01:38:07.541
maybe I help.

01:38:10.666 --> 01:38:13.083
What do you need inside vault?

01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:16.500
It's...

01:38:17.416 --> 01:38:18.625
like a book.

01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:21.166
-A special book.
-How?

01:38:22.541 --> 01:38:23.541
Special?

01:38:25.041 --> 01:38:27.791
Humans lost their ability to speak.

01:38:27.958 --> 01:38:29.708
And this book might bring it back.

01:38:31.375 --> 01:38:33.166
A book can do this?

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.250
This one can.

01:38:42.666 --> 01:38:47.250
Raka said apes and humans

01:38:48.583 --> 01:38:50.208
lived side by side.

01:38:52.833 --> 01:38:54.166
True or not true?

01:38:57.291 --> 01:38:58.458
Apes were silent.

01:39:00.208 --> 01:39:01.416
Like the Echo.

01:39:03.083 --> 01:39:04.666
Humans were dominant.

01:39:06.166 --> 01:39:07.541
The virus spread...

01:39:08.791 --> 01:39:10.250
that we created.

01:39:11.291 --> 01:39:12.916
It made apes smarter.

01:39:14.291 --> 01:39:16.291
And it almost killed all of us.

01:39:23.166 --> 01:39:25.875
You know a way inside, yes?

01:39:27.541 --> 01:39:28.541
Yes.

01:39:30.125 --> 01:39:31.916
One last question.

01:39:35.083 --> 01:39:39.333
Will water destroy what is inside?

01:39:55.916 --> 01:39:57.166

01:39:59.791 --> 01:40:00.791

A climb.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.500
One I cannot do alone.

01:40:19.666 --> 01:40:20.666
Why?

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.750
To free our clan.

Soona, this is Mae.

01:41:29.666 --> 01:41:30.791
Hello, Soona.

01:41:35.291 --> 01:41:36.625
What do we do?

01:41:38.708 --> 01:41:40.208
We're gonna need all of this.

01:41:41.208 --> 01:41:42.375
Follow me.

01:41:56.083 --> 01:41:57.250
Careful.

01:42:00.208 --> 01:42:04.083
The power runs through, yes?

01:42:06.416 --> 01:42:07.416
Yes.

01:42:23.833 --> 01:42:27.416
You cannot make hard climb...

01:42:30.291 --> 01:42:31.791
without Anaya.

01:42:36.125 --> 01:42:37.666

01:42:45.833 --> 01:42:47.000

[â™ª suspenseful music continues]

01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:05.333
[Mae] This burns hot.

01:43:05.875 --> 01:43:07.375
But under pressure,

01:43:08.791 --> 01:43:10.833
it will explode.

01:43:12.250 --> 01:43:14.166
How do you know this?

01:43:14.541 --> 01:43:16.458
[Anaya grunting]

01:43:20.666 --> 01:43:21.875

-[Mae] Take that over there.
-[Anaya] Okay.

01:43:31.708 --> 01:43:33.625
I go with Anaya.

01:43:34.208 --> 01:43:35.791
Safer that way.

01:43:37.166 --> 01:43:40.208
Anaya! Anaya. Stop.

01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:42.958
-You're doing it wrong.
-[Anaya] Okay.

01:43:43.125 --> 01:43:44.250
You like her.

01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:47.750
Soona.

01:43:49.875 --> 01:43:51.791
We were born within a sunset.

01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:56.666
[Soona] No. Anaya...

01:43:56.833 --> 01:43:58.583

01:44:13.958 --> 01:44:15.583
You had an opportunity.

01:44:16.125 --> 01:44:18.416
I gave you an opportunity.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.625
But you're fantasizing about a past
that can never come back.

01:44:30.166 --> 01:44:31.541
Listen to me.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.416
Trevathan, you don't belong here.

but it's not.

01:44:43.916 --> 01:44:47.916

for what happened here.
