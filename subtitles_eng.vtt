40:42.000 --> 40:43.541
Hmm.

40:50.166 --> 40:53.500
He was my village.

40:56.708 --> 40:58.708
They killed him.

Did you see my clan?

41:48.291 --> 41:49.333
No.

41:50.208 --> 41:51.625
I hid.

41:52.833 --> 41:54.208
I survived.

41:55.666 --> 41:58.750
I protected our work.

42:08.166 --> 42:13.791
They are an ancient way to store ideas.

42:18.875 --> 42:21.500
The symbols have meaning.

42:25.583 --> 42:28.666
Apes understood this meaning...

42:28.833 --> 42:30.875
in the time of Caesar.

42:33.458 --> 42:36.875
The Masks, in my village...

42:38.375 --> 42:40.375
said that name...

42:42.333 --> 42:43.791
"Caesar."

42:44.875 --> 42:46.250
Shameful.

42:47.333 --> 42:49.541
The Masks take his name.

42:51.041 --> 42:52.416
Twist his words.

Who is he?

Not "is."

"Was."

Your clan does not know
the true Caesar. [grunts]

43:07.916 --> 43:11.125
Too many have forgotten who he was.

43:13.250 --> 43:16.041
I know Elders of my village.

43:16.208 --> 43:17.916
They made the law.

-That is everything.

43:21.208 --> 43:24.083
That is not everything.

43:24.875 --> 43:27.000
Long before your Elders...

43:27.166 --> 43:31.416
it was Caesar who taught us
what it means to be ape.

43:31.583 --> 43:36.041
He was our leader, our lawgiver.

43:36.208 --> 43:38.958
Apes together strong.

43:39.125 --> 43:41.833
Ape shall not kill ape.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.750
We, the Order of Caesar...

43:44.916 --> 43:46.666
follow his words.

43:46.833 --> 43:48.291
To this day...

43:49.666 --> 43:51.125
I follow.

43:52.791 --> 43:54.083
I am now...

43:55.416 --> 43:56.833

-[Raka hums]
-What is this place?

44:07.083 --> 44:09.958
We believe apes built this...

44:10.125 --> 44:13.666
as a refuge for humans.

44:13.833 --> 44:15.708
Now it is rare to see even one.

44:15.875 --> 44:21.166
But in Caesar's time,
there were vast herds of them.

44:22.250 --> 44:24.916
Can you imagine? [chuckles]

44:25.000 --> 44:29.541
Perhaps here,
humans were cared for, fed...

44:29.708 --> 44:33.500
maybe even taught. [laughs]

You have seen one?

44:54.666 --> 44:55.666
One.

44:57.500 --> 44:59.666
They are scavengers.

44:59.833 --> 45:01.541
Like boars.

45:01.708 --> 45:03.333
Only lesser.

45:03.500 --> 45:06.541
Humans are slow-witted, but...

45:08.708 --> 45:10.250
there was a time...

45:11.166 --> 45:15.083
when humans and apes lived side by side.

45:17.125 --> 45:18.916
[Raka chuckles]

45:19.000 --> 45:24.250
Yes, it is a puzzle. I know. But...

45:25.583 --> 45:28.333
they were important to Caesar. Hmm.

45:28.500 --> 45:32.666
So they are important to me.

45:37.166 --> 45:39.250
I have to get to my horse.

45:40.541 --> 45:42.083
Of course.

45:42.250 --> 45:43.416
Follow me.

45:47.125 --> 45:49.791
You do not know Caesar.

45:51.291 --> 45:53.666
You do not know books.

45:57.708 --> 45:59.666
You should stay here.

46:26.875 --> 46:30.291
She follows you from your village?

46:34.000 --> 46:38.750
Perhaps Caesar bids me travel.

46:42.833 --> 46:45.500
Wait here. The work continues.

46:45.666 --> 46:46.833
I have no time for...

46:47.000 --> 46:50.166
I will not slow you down.
I, too, keep a horse.

We raise eagles, my clan.

01:05:29.708 --> 01:05:31.166
She spoke.

01:05:34.041 --> 01:05:36.375
She called my name.

01:05:36.541 --> 01:05:38.875
You misheard.

01:05:39.041 --> 01:05:43.708
You said this Nova was smarter than most.

01:05:43.875 --> 01:05:45.333
[Raka] Within reason.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.750
Some intelligence, to be sure, but...

01:05:48.916 --> 01:05:50.458
I have a name.

01:05:52.375 --> 01:05:53.375
Mae.

01:05:57.791 --> 01:06:00.000

01:06:06.208 --> 01:06:07.375

01:06:09.375 --> 01:06:10.958
It's a human settlement.

01:06:12.625 --> 01:06:14.250
It's where I'm headed to.

01:06:14.875 --> 01:06:16.541
Looking for more like me.

01:06:16.708 --> 01:06:18.166
There are more...

There used to be more.

01:06:25.291 --> 01:06:28.333
You hid the truth?

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.708
My mother taught me silence...

01:06:32.208 --> 01:06:33.833
for my safety.

01:06:34.583 --> 01:06:37.583
You were safe with us.

01:06:38.166 --> 01:06:40.875
And still not true.

01:06:42.125 --> 01:06:44.583
Where is your mother now?

01:06:47.875 --> 01:06:49.833
I am alone.

01:06:50.625 --> 01:06:53.041

Now I am Caesar.

Now, when I think of all the treasures
left inside for us...

01:22:08.250 --> 01:22:09.541
Oh...

01:22:10.041 --> 01:22:13.000
I feel very good.

01:22:15.583 --> 01:22:18.000
It may be difficult to open.

01:22:19.083 --> 01:22:20.583
But not impossible...

01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:23.666
because we work together.

01:22:24.708 --> 01:22:27.083
All as one.

01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:29.166
As Caesar wanted.

01:22:29.333 --> 01:22:32.291
As Caesar required.

01:22:32.458 --> 01:22:35.125

Yes! [echoes]

Don't worry.

Whoever's in there is either dead or gone.

01:24:19.875 --> 01:24:22.791
We've been bangin'
on that door for months.

[chuckles and grunts]

01:24:25.875 --> 01:24:27.666
[Mae] Do you not know where we are?

01:24:28.291 --> 01:24:31.583
When things got bad
and the government went underground,

01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:33.625
this is where half of it went.

01:24:33.791 --> 01:24:36.958
With all their technology,
and all their weapons...

01:24:39.375 --> 01:24:40.708
Don't you understand?

01:24:41.625 --> 01:24:43.875
That ape cannot have what is inside the...

01:24:44.041 --> 01:24:47.166
You gotta stop thinking
about the way things were

01:24:47.333 --> 01:24:49.625
and start thinking about the way they are.

01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:51.708
This is a good life,

01:24:51.875 --> 01:24:54.250
and you have a chance to be a part of it.

01:24:54.833 --> 01:24:57.208
What, and build a world for the apes?

01:24:57.375 --> 01:25:00.166
It is already their world.

01:25:03.666 --> 01:25:04.958
[Trevathan sighs]

01:25:08.291 --> 01:25:11.250
There's hot water and fresh clothes
in that room back there.

01:25:12.833 --> 01:25:15.583
You'll feel better
when you get yourself cleaned up.

01:25:17.166 --> 01:25:19.625
You better figure out
how to be useful around here.

01:25:31.875 --> 01:25:34.083
We had no choice.

01:25:35.916 --> 01:25:37.458
You must accept.

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:39.833
[Soona sighs]

01:25:40.791 --> 01:25:41.958
It is law.

01:25:44.208 --> 01:25:49.208
The Elders did not tell us everything

01:25:49.375 --> 01:25:51.416
about this world.

01:25:52.333 --> 01:25:56.000
They did not tell us
because they did not know.

01:25:57.291 --> 01:26:00.416
They did not want to know.

You two have come a long way.

An ape and a human

01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:20.375
traveling together is...

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.416
quite an adventure.

you are familiar with the concept of...

evolution?

01:28:01.833 --> 01:28:04.375
That is the human label, yeah?

01:28:04.541 --> 01:28:09.000
The advancement
that I crave requires time.

01:28:09.166 --> 01:28:13.041
Vast amounts of time that I do not have.

01:28:14.375 --> 01:28:17.583
Unfortunately, I am but a mortal ape.

-[Proximus chuckles]
-[chuckles]

01:28:19.833 --> 01:28:24.833
So this is why I need to get the knowledge
inside that vault.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.291
I believe it will deliver

01:28:26.458 --> 01:28:29.708
instant evolution.

01:28:30.708 --> 01:28:32.875

In their time,

01:28:38.250 --> 01:28:43.875
humans were capable
of many great things, yes?

01:28:44.041 --> 01:28:46.291
They could level mountains.

01:28:48.083 --> 01:28:50.500
They could speak across oceans.

01:28:50.666 --> 01:28:53.250
They could fly, Noa.

01:28:53.791 --> 01:28:55.625
Like eagles fly.

01:28:55.791 --> 01:28:58.875
But now, we will learn.

Apes will learn. I will learn, yeah,

01:29:02.708 --> 01:29:05.583
from what is inside that vault.

my apes did not realize their value,

01:29:53.708 --> 01:29:57.333
so I was brought only bodies.

01:29:58.208 --> 01:30:02.625
I could not speak to them
like I can speak to you.

01:30:04.541 --> 01:30:05.541
I know...

01:30:06.666 --> 01:30:10.041
you are coming here
to get inside my vault.

01:30:10.208 --> 01:30:11.833
It is not yours!

It is now, isn't it?

I have heard that you are
a very clever ape, yeah?

01:30:34.666 --> 01:30:35.666
Very clever.

broken staffs, Trevathan.

01:30:51.083 --> 01:30:55.125
did Mae tell you
how to get inside my vault?

01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:01.916
She told me nothing.

the tools inside my vault.

Tools that make humans strong

01:32:22.458 --> 01:32:24.541
and make them dangerous.

01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:29.250
